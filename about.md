- A course on demystifying Unreal Engine
    - Who is this course for:
        - aspiring game developers/designers
        - they already have some knowledge but the editor is daunting
        - they feel there is no valid tutorials out there
        - or if there are any, they lack clarity

    - The purpose of this course is
        - to provide a system to make developers walk on their own two feets
        - rather than giving basic information
        - focus on the overall aspects
        - the system is more than its sub component

    - At the end of the course the student will be able to:
        - understand the process of building a game from start to finish
        - subdivide the project into its main core sections
        - use modern continuous delivery techniques to:
        - iterate fast
        - keeping the project as stable as possible
        - Use game design to guide the project development timeline
