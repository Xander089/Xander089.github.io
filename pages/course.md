## Intro

- A course on demystifying Unreal Engine
- Who is this course for:
    - aspiring game developers/designers
    - they already have some knowledge but the editor is daunting
    - they feel there is no valid tutorials out there
    - or if there are any, they lack clarity

- The purpose of this course is
    - to provide a system to make developers walk on their own two feets
    - rather than giving basic information
    - focus on the overall aspects
    - the system is more than its sub component

- At the end of the course the student will be able to:
    - understand the process of building a game from start to finish
    - subdivide the project into its main core sections
    - use modern continuous delivery techniques to:
        - iterate fast
        - keeping the project as stable as possible

  - Use game design to guide the project development timeline
